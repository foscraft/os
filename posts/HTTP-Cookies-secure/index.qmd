Cookies are small packets of data sent by the server and stored in the browser.

The data they contain can be sensitive and personal, such as access tokens and session IDs, an obvious target for attackers. For this reason, securing them is vital.

Securely configuring cookies to keep their data safer should always be a priority if you decide your site requires them.

Below are the attributes you should know to ensure cookie security👇🏼

`Session vs. Persistent cookies`

Cookies can be valid for a certain time using the ‘max-age’ or ‘expires’ attribute.

Using these makes a Cookie persistent, meaning it will persist even if the browser restarts as long as the expiry date is set sometime in the future.

The opposite of a persistent cookie is a session cookie when the ‘max-age’ or ‘expires’ attributes are omitted.

Session cookies will expire automatically when the browser closes (the session ends).

`The ‘Secure’ Flag`

The secure flag prevents a cookie from being sent over an unencrypted connection.

You should always use this when configuring cookies carrying sensitive data, as it will always be sent over HTTPS, which removes the risk of interception attacks.

`The ‘HTTPOnly’ Flag`

By default, all cookies can be accessed and read by JavaScript.

The HTTPOnly flag tells the browser not to share the cookie with JavaScript by removing it from the ‘window.cookie’ variable, allowing it to stay hidden between the browser and server.

`The ‘SameSite’ Flag`

This flag eliminates the risk of CSRF(Cross-Site-Request-Forgery). It prevents the cookie from being used in requests generated from different origins.

‘SameSite’ causes the browser to check if the request origin matches the origin that set the cookie.

`Summary`

Never store sensitive data in cookies unless it's a necessity.

Always use the SameSite, HTTPOnly, and Secure flags.

Aim to use session cookies for sensitive data. If you use persistent cookies, keep their lifetime short and expire them soon.

Common Linux Filesystem hierarchy

![](best.jpg)

`/` - This is the root of your filesystem, where everything begins.

`/etc` - This directory contains system configuration files.

`/home` - This is the default home directory for all users (except the root user).

`/root` - This is the home directory for the root user.

`/dev` - This is where your devices such as your hard disks, USB drives, and optical drives reside on your system.

`/opt` - This is where you can install additional 3rd party software.

`/boot` - All the files required for your system to boot are stored here.

`/bin` - This is where essential binaries (programs) reside on your system. In other words, your Linux commands executables.

`/sbin` - This is where system binaries (programs) that are typically used by the system administrator are stored. Commands here require sudo access.

`/op`t - This is where you can install additional 3rd party software (not coming from your distribution's package manager).

`/tmp` - This is where temporary files are stored; they are usually deleted after a system reboot, so never store important files here!

`/var` - This directory contains files that may change in size, such as mail spools and log files. Many sysadmins store their web services here.

`/usr` - This directory contains files and utilities that are shared between users.

`/lib` - This directory contains libraries needed by the essential binaries in the /bin and /sbin directories. A library is basically a set of precompiled functions that can be used by a program.

`/proc` - This is where information about running processes is stored.

You will have more files under your root (/) directory.
I have only chosen the most important and common ones that should exist on every Linux distribution.

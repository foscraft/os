REST API is often used in web applications to access data from a server.\n\n`API Client`\n\nAn API Client is a software program that makes it easy to work with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\n\nIt can be used to access data or perform actions on behalf of a user.\n\nAPI Clients are often used by developers to test APIs.\n\n`API Resource`\n\nAn API resource is a specific type of data that can be accessed by an application programming interface (API).\nAPI Server\n\nAn API server allows two different systems to communicate with each other.\n\nIn most cases, an API server enables a web application to interact with a database.\n\n`API Scalability`\n\nAPI scalability refers to the ability of an API to handle increased loads of data or traffic without adversely affecting performance.\n\nA scalable API can handle large amounts of data and traffic without compromising speed or functionality.\n\n`Stateless API`\n\nA stateless API is an API that does not maintain a state between requests.\n\nEach request is independent of any other request, and state information is not stored on the server.\n\n`API Cache`\n\nAn API is cacheable if the data it returns can be stored in a cache.\n\nCache allows the same data to be returned for multiple requests without having to fetch it from the original source each time.\n\nCaching can improve performance.\n\n`Layered System`\n\nA layered system, means that each layer is responsible for a specific set of tasks.\n\nThe most common layers are the presentation layer, the business logic layer, and the data access layer."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":"solar","title-block-banner":true,"title":"REST APIs","author":"foscraft","date":"2022-12-01","categories":["APIs","tech","programming","engineering"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

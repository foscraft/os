For this reason, securing them is vital.\n\n![](http.jpeg)\n\nSecurely configuring cookies to keep their data safer should always be a priority if you decide your site requires them.\n\nBelow are the attributes you should know to ensure cookie securityüëáüèº\n\n`Session vs. Persistent cookies`\n\nCookies can be valid for a certain time using the ‚Äòmax-age‚Äô or ‚Äòexpires‚Äô attribute.\n\nUsing these makes a Cookie persistent, meaning it will persist even if the browser restarts as long as the expiry date is set sometime in the future.\n\nThe opposite of a persistent cookie is a session cookie when the ‚Äòmax-age‚Äô or ‚Äòexpires‚Äô attributes are omitted.\n\nSession cookies will expire automatically when the browser closes (the session ends).\n\n`The ‚ÄòSecure‚Äô Flag`\n\nThe secure flag prevents a cookie from being sent over an unencrypted connection.\n\nYou should always use this when configuring cookies carrying sensitive data, as it will always be sent over HTTPS, which removes the risk of interception attacks.\n\n`The ‚ÄòHTTPOnly‚Äô Flag`\n\nBy default, all cookies can be accessed and read by JavaScript.\n\nThe HTTPOnly flag tells the browser not to share the cookie with JavaScript by removing it from the ‚Äòwindow.cookie‚Äô variable, allowing it to stay hidden between the browser and server.\n\n`The ‚ÄòSameSite‚Äô Flag`\n\nThis flag eliminates the risk of CSRF(Cross-Site-Request-Forgery). It prevents the cookie from being used in requests generated from different origins.\n\n‚ÄòSameSite‚Äô causes the browser to check if the request origin matches the origin that set the cookie.\n\n`Summary`\n\nNever store sensitive data in cookies unless it's a necessity.\n\nAlways use the SameSite, HTTPOnly, and Secure flags.\n\nAim to use session cookies for sensitive data. If you use persistent cookies, keep their lifetime short and expire them soon.\n\nI hope you liked this thread!\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":"solar","title-block-banner":true,"title":"How to keep your HTTP Cookies secure.","author":"foscraft","date":"2022-12-01","categories":["code","analysis","APIs"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

Instead of the traditional HTTP call, RPC uses a function call.\n\nIt means that on the client-side, you invoke a function that is written on the server-side code.\n\n`CORS`\n\nCORS is an HTTP-based mechanism that lets you request data from one URL to a different URL.\n\nCheck out this note for more details: üëáüèª Screenshot from 2022-09-16 15-18-30\n\n`Async API`\n\nAsyncAPI is an open-source project aimed at improving the current state of Event-Driven Architecture.\n\nThese APIs allow relatively time-consuming requests to be processed in the background while other requests are made.\n\n`Internal API`\n\nInternal API, also known as Private API is only accessible to the developers within an organization.\n\n`API Caching`\n\nAPI Caching is the ability to store copies of frequently accessed data in several places along the request-response path.\n\n`External API`\n\nExternal API, also known as Public API is accessible to all the developers outside the enterprise or organization.\n\n`HTTP cookies`\n\nAn HTTP cookie is a small piece of data created by the web server inside your browser.\n\nThe data inside a cookie has an ID that is unique to you and your computer. This ID helps the server know who the user is to send the data accordingly.\n\n`Authorization`\n\nAuthorization always comes after authentication. It is the process of permitting users to access different resources from the server, and it‚Äôs not visible and changeable by the user.\n\n`Microservices`\n\nA microservice is an application design that breaks up a monolithic architecture into small, self-containing services.\n\n`OpenAPI spec`\n\nIt is a format to define structure and syntax for REST APIs. It provides a standard that allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the service's capabilities without access to source code, documentation, or traffic inspection.\n\n`Composite API`\n\nComposite API is a design approach in which we bundle multiple API requests into a single API call.\n\n`API Versioning`\n\nAPI versioning is the practice of managing changes in your API.\n\nYou should version your API if you are introducing any breaking changes. Clients can still access the old version, and their products will not break as soon as you launch a new release.\n\n`Authentication`\n\nAuthentication and authorization are the two most confusing terms.\n\nAuthentication is validating the user to identify if they are who they claim to be.\n\n`API Lifecycle`\n\nAPI lifecycle is the entire lifespan of any particular API from its planning phase to when it gets stale."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":"solar","title-block-banner":true,"title":"API related terms","author":"foscraft","date":"2022-12-01","categories":["APIs","tech","programming","engineering"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
